# Introduction

The jupyter notebook 'track_analysis.ipynb' does some basic trackset analysis and plots some useful charts described below:

1. Filter tracks for user-defined location X and Y with search radius (default 300 miles)
2. Plot filteres tracks for locations X, Y and conditional occurence Y | X
3. Plot probability density for Vm (cyclone windspeed)
4. Plot annual frequency breakdown by hurricane category (saffir simpson scale)
5. plot exceedance probability for location X and Y

The following python packages are required:
numpy,
pandas,
matplotlib,
cartopy,
glob,
cartopy,
shapely
